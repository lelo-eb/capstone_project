Project Proposal: Recipe Sharing Website

1. Tech Stack:
For this project, I will be using React for the front end and Node.js for the back end. The focus will be on front-end development, with a simple yet functional back end to support the core features of the application.

2. Platform:
The application will be a website, accessible through desktop and mobile browsers. By focusing on a web-based platform, I aim to reach a broader audience and ensure compatibility across different devices and operating systems.

3. Goal:
The goal of the project is to create a user-friendly platform where individuals can easily share and discover recipes. Users will be able to upload their own recipes, explore recipes shared by others, rate and comment on recipes, and interact with other users within the community.

4. User Demographic:
The target users for the website will include cooking enthusiasts, home chefs, and individuals interested in exploring new recipes and culinary experiences. The demographic will likely include a wide range of age groups and backgrounds, reflecting the universal appeal of food and cooking.

5. Data Collection:
I will create a simple back-end API to handle data storage and retrieval for the recipe sharing functionality. The API will store user profiles, recipe details, ratings, comments, and other relevant information. Additionally, I will explore options for integrating nutritional information into the recipes to provide users with a comprehensive view of their meal choices.

6. Approach:
a. Front-End Focus: As a front-end developer, my primary focus will be on building out the front-end user interface and experience. I will leverage React to create a responsive and visually appealing website that prioritizes usability and accessibility. It will however be a full stack application with the necessary backend features.

b. Database Schema: The database schema will include tables for users, recipes, ratings, comments, and other related entities. For example, the recipes table will contain fields such as recipe ID, title, ingredients, instructions, and user ID for ownership.

c. Features: The website will include features such as user registration and authentication, recipe uploading, recipe search and filtering, rating and commenting on recipes, favoriting recipes, and generating shopping lists based on selected recipes.

d. User Flow: The user flow will begin with the registration and profile setup process. Users can then browse recipes, upload their own recipes, interact with recipes through ratings and comments, and save their favorite recipes for future reference. The website will provide a seamless and intuitive user experience from start to finish.

e. Stretch Goals: While the primary focus will be on building out the core features of the website, potential stretch goals could include implementing advanced search and filtering options, integrating social sharing capabilities, and enhancing the user interface with interactive elements and animations.
